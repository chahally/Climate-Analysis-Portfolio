Climate-Analysis-Portfolio

Overview
This repository contains two data analysis projects exploring long-term climate trends: 

1. Global Temperature Change (1880–2025)
2. Atmospheric CO₂ Change (1958–2025)  

Both projects demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualisation using Python (pandas, matplotlib).

Project 1: Global Temperature Change

Objective:
To analyse how global temperatures have changed over the last century and visualise trends over time using NASA’s Land-Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI) dataset.

Dataset:  
- Source: [NASA GISS](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)  
- Monthly global, northern, and southern hemisphere temperature anomalies (deviation from 1951–1980 mean) from 1880 to present.

Methodology:
1. Loaded data into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. Cleaned the data by converting missing values (`***`) to `NaN` and removed unnecessary columns.  
3. Focused on monthly averages (`Jan–Dec`) and calculated annual trends.  
4. Visualised data using line plots in matplotlib.

Findings:
- Global temperatures have increased steadily since 1880.  
- Recent decades show a **faster rate of warming**, consistent with climate change patterns.  
- Seasonal variation exists, but the long-term trend is **clearly upward**.  

Skills demonstrated: 
Data cleaning, handling missing data, grouping, plotting trends, basic EDA.

Project 2: Atmospheric CO₂ Change

Objective:
To analyse the rise in atmospheric CO₂ levels over time using NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory data.

Dataset:
- Source: [NOAA Mauna Loa CO₂](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html)  
- Monthly mean CO₂ concentrations from 1958 to present.

Methodology:
1. Loaded data into pandas and handled missing values (`-99.99`).  
2. Calculated yearly averages using `groupby` to smooth short-term fluctuations.  
3. Created a line plot with a 5-year rolling average to highlight the long-term trend.

Findings: 
- CO₂ levels have risen from around 315 ppm in 1958 to over 420 ppm in recent years.  
- The rise is consistent and accelerating over time.  
- Seasonal oscillations exist due to natural processes, but the overall trend is strongly upward.  

Skills demonstrated: 
Data cleaning, grouping by year, rolling averages, plotting trends, interpreting real-world datasets.

Conclusion
These projects demonstrate the ability to work with real-world climate data, clean and structure it for analysis, visualise long-term trends, and interpret findings. Both datasets clearly show accelerating changes in Earth’s climate, providing insight into global warming and human impact on the environment.
