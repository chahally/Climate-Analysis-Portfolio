# How Has Global CO₂ Concentration Changed Over Time?

This notebook analyses atmospheric CO₂ concentration data from the Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) between 1958 and 2025.  
The goal is to explore how CO₂ levels have changed over time and visualise the long-term trend.

## Step 1: Import libraries
Using Python libraries for data handling, analysis, and visualisation.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
import plotly

---

## Step 2: Load the dataset

The dataset is the Mauna Loa monthly CO₂ record, available from the [NOAA ESRL website](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html).

df = pd.read_csv('data/co2_data.txt', comment='#')
df.head()

---

## Step 3: Explore the data
Checking the structure and quality of the dataset.

df.info()

df.isnull().sum()

No missing values are present, so we can proceed with the analysis.

## Step 4: Aggregate the data by year

Calculating the average annual CO₂ concentration to observe the long-term trend.

co2_yearly = df.groupby('year')['average'].mean().reset_index()
co2_yearly.head()

---

## Step 5: Visualise the trend
Plotting the yearly average CO₂ concentrations to see how they’ve changed since 1958.

plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(co2_yearly['year'], co2_yearly['average'], color='green', marker='o', linestyle='-')

plt.title('Average Atmospheric CO₂ Concentration (Mauna Loa, Hawaii)', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('CO₂ Concentration (ppm)')
plt.grid(True)

# Save the figure
plt.savefig('images/co2_trend.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')

plt.show()

## Step 6: Summary

- Atmospheric CO₂ concentration has steadily increased from around 315 ppm in 1958 to over 425 ppm in 2025.
- This reflects the impact of human-driven emissions and industrialisation.
- The Mauna Loa record is one of the most important long-term climate datasets, showing a clear upward trend consistent with global warming research.
